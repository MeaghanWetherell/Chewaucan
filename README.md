Finding Lake Chewaucan is an educational game design project from the University of Arizona. It is currently still being completed, with an anticipated final release date of Spring 2026. In the meantime, you can feel free to download and play around with any component you like under a CC-BY license (aka, use for free in anything, just make sure to mention where you got it). We are trying to make our game modular, meaning that you can break pieces off to use in your own projects (educational or otherwise). Below is a list of a few of the module instructions/readmes and what they cover.
    
    Attaching different footprint sounds to different terrain textures: 
          Assets/Scripts/Movement/README_Footsteps.txt
    
    A map and waypoint system for fast travel across or within scenes/levels, and includes the option to lock certain waypoints to quest progress: 
          Assets/Scripts/MapSystem/README_MapSystem.txt
    
    A spline tool to easily create fences or roads and adjust them directly to the terrain elevation: 
          Assets/Scripts/MapSystem/SplineFences/README_SplineAlignToTerrain.txt
    
    Create ambient sounds that play throughout the map or only in local zones: 
        Assets/Scripts/SoundEffects/README_AmbientSounds.txt

And while we haven't finished detailed readmes for them, here are some of the other resources our game includes:

    A movement system that includes running, walking, swimming and climbing with stamina and oxygen bars

    A match3 game used to identify bones, though you could put any sort of object in, and which accepts 3D objects 

    A narration system and quest system

    Plenty of assets including things like barbed wire fences, juniper trees, sagebrush, cheatgrass, and lots of bones and archeological equipment.
