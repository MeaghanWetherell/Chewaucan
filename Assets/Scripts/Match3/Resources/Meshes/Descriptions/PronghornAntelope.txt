Pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana) are not actually related to African antelope. Instead, they're more closely related to giraffes. Those horns? They're actually ossicones, which are bones covered in skin and a keratinous sheath (like a fingernail). Except that they shed the fingernail, which if you also do that you should go get that checked by a doctor.
